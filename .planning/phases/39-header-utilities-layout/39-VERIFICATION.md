# Phase 39: Header Utilities Layout Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Header utilities cluster restyled to the approved `.tk-*` design — two refined flag icons (active full color / inactive dimmed ~0.4, no ring), styled currency dropdown (custom chevron, OS arrow hidden), cart icon + count in approved LTR order Flags → Currency → Cart with correct spacing; RTL-correct true mirror on `/he`.
**Verified:** 2026-06-24
**Status:** passed (human verification approved 2026-06-24)
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Two separate round flag icons; active full color (opacity 1), inactive dimmed (0.4), no ring (SC1/HEADER-01) | ✓ VERIFIED (code) | header.ejs:23,30 two distinct `.flag-icon` SVGs (US `flag-icons-us`, IL `flag-icons-il`); homepage.css:432-444 `.flag-icon{opacity:0.4;border-radius:round}`, `:hover{0.85}`, `.selected{opacity:1}`; zero `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px` matches (gold + white rings removed) |
| 2 | Currency renders as styled dropdown, OS arrow hidden, custom chevron solid #666666 / transparent #ffffff (SC2/HEADER-02) | ✓ VERIFIED (code) | homepage.css:447-471 `appearance:none` + `-webkit-appearance:none`, `background-color:transparent`, solid `stroke='%23666666'` data-URI, transparent-variant `stroke='%23ffffff'` override, `background-position:right 6px center`, `background-size:12px 12px`, `padding:4px 24px 4px 8px` |
| 3 | LTR order Flags → Currency → Cart with correct spacing (SC3/HEADER-03) | ✓ VERIFIED (code) | header.ejs:21-56 DOM order inside `.tk-nav__utils` = `.tk-lang` (flags) → `select.tk-nav__currency-select` → `a.tk-nav__cart`; homepage.css:116 `.tk-nav__utils{display:flex;gap:1.4rem}` |
| 4 | RTL true mirror on /he: cart left, flags right, badge flips left, chevron flips left, centering preserved (SC4/HEADER-04) | ✓ VERIFIED (code) | homepage.css:473-480 `[dir="rtl"] .tk-nav{row-reverse}`, `.tk-nav__utils{row-reverse}`, `.tk-nav__count{right:auto;left:-8px}`, `.tk-nav__currency-select{background-position:left 6px center;padding:4px 8px 4px 24px}`; LTR `.tk-nav__count` retains `right:-8px`; no `[dir="rtl"] .tk-nav__links` rule (centering untouched) |
| 5 | Currency options read `$ USD` / `₪ ILS` on both /en and /he | ✓ VERIFIED | header.ejs:46-47 literal `$ USD` / `₪ ILS` (no language conditional); default option keeps bilingual `Currency`/`מטבע`; no `דולר`/`שקל` remain |
| 6 | Labels persist after View.js hydration (not reverted) | ✓ VERIFIED (source) | View.js:1053-1062 `updateCurrencySelectorText` sets `options[1].text='$ USD'`, `options[2].text='₪ ILS'` in BOTH eng and heb branches; options[0] + dir add/remove logic intact. Browser effect pending build (deferred). |
| 7 | Each flag has aria-label + title; active flag carries aria-current="true" | ✓ VERIFIED | header.ejs:23,30 `aria-label`+`title="English"`/`title="עברית"`; `aria-current="true"` gated per-language (exactly twice, behind `_eng`/`!_eng`) |
| 8 | hydratePrototypeChrome performs no destructive header innerHTML rewrite | ✓ VERIFIED | View.js:981-1016 only binds flag-click nav, calls `updateCurrencySelectorText`, `persistCartNumber`, `setPageSpecificLanguage`; zero `innerHTML` touching header/tk-nav/flag/currency anywhere in View.js |
| 9 | Dead `.tk-nav__currency` CSS block removed | ✓ VERIFIED | Zero matches for `.tk-nav__currency {` (bare, no `-select`); `.tk-nav__currency-select` rules intact |
| 10 | Doc-sync: ROADMAP/REQUIREMENTS amended to two-flag-icon design | ✓ VERIFIED | Zero `single rounded pill`/`flag pill` matches; ROADMAP SC1/3/4 + REQUIREMENTS HEADER-01/03 reworded; `two separate`/`two refined` present |

**Score:** 10/10 truths verified at code level. 4 visual outcomes require human browser confirmation (see below).

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/css/homepage.css` | Flag opacity states, currency chevron, RTL block, dead-block removal | ✓ VERIFIED | All Plan-01 acceptance patterns present (lines 116, 432-480); no ring box-shadows; raw-served (no build needed) |
| `backend/views/partials/header.ejs` | `$ USD`/`₪ ILS` labels, flag title + aria-current, JS hooks intact | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 21-56; all `value=`/`id=`/`class=`/`data-lang` hooks preserved; DOM order Flags→Currency→Cart |
| `frontend/js/View.js` | Mirror labels in both branches, no header innerHTML rewrite | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 1053-1062 mirror; hydratePrototypeChrome (981-1016) non-destructive; legacy `getCurrencySelectorMarkup` correctly untouched |
| `.planning/ROADMAP.md` | Amended SC 1/3/4 | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 120-134 two-flag/Flags→Currency→Cart/RTL-true-mirror wording |
| `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` | Amended HEADER-01/03 | ✓ VERIFIED | Lines 12-14; traceability table HEADER-01..04 → Phase 39 |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `[dir="rtl"] .tk-nav` rules | `html[dir='rtl']` set server-side on /he | attribute selector | ✓ WIRED | homepage.css uses `[dir="rtl"]`; project convention (tokens.css `[dir='rtl']`) confirms server sets `dir` on /he |
| header.ejs option text `$ USD`/`₪ ILS` | View.js updateCurrencySelectorText | dual-render mirror | ✓ WIRED | Both emit identical literals; hydration call site View.js:1002-1004 targets `select.header-currency-selector[name="currency"]` matching header.ejs:44 |
| flag `data-lang` | View.js click navigation | event binding | ✓ WIRED | View.js:984-998 binds `.flag-icon[data-lang]` → full-page lang navigation; hooks present in header.ejs |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HEADER-01 | 39-01, 39-02, 39-03 | Two separate refined flag icons; active full color / inactive dimmed (no ring) | ✓ SATISFIED (code) | header.ejs two SVG flags; CSS opacity-only states; a11y attrs; doc-synced |
| HEADER-02 | 39-01, 39-02 | Currency renders as styled dropdown | ✓ SATISFIED (code) | appearance:none + custom chevron; `$ USD`/`₪ ILS` labels |
| HEADER-03 | 39-01, 39-03 | Utilities in order Flags → Currency → Cart + spacing | ✓ SATISFIED (code) | DOM order + flex gap; doc-synced |
| HEADER-04 | 39-01, 39-03 | RTL mirror on /he | ✓ SATISFIED (code) | `[dir="rtl"]` mirror block; badge + chevron flip; doc-synced |

No orphaned requirements — all four HEADER IDs are claimed by phase plans and mapped to Phase 39 in the traceability table.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | — | None | — | No TODO/FIXME/placeholder/stub patterns in modified files. Legacy `getCurrencySelectorMarkup` retains old USD/ILS labels but is the `.menu`-path (not prototype chrome) and was correctly left untouched per plan. |

### Behavioral Spot-Checks

Skipped — phase output is CSS/EJS/JS chrome whose outcomes are visual. No isolated runnable behavior to assert without a browser (routed to human verification). All six documented commits confirmed present (`a6f43ca`, `77e98a3`, `df13ae4`, `ef89ceb`, `cf100e2`, `d173848`).

### Human Verification Required

1. **LTR header (/en):** two flags (active full color, inactive dimmed, no ring); order Flags → Currency → Cart with even spacing.
2. **Currency dropdown:** OS arrow hidden, custom chevron visible (dark on solid nav, white over hero); options `$ USD` / `₪ ILS`.
3. **RTL header (/he):** true mirror — utils at left, order Cart → Currency → Flags; badge on left of cart; chevron on left; nav links centered, logo at edge.
4. **Post-build label persistence:** after `npm run build` + backend restart, `$ USD`/`₪ ILS` persist with no flash-revert after hydration.

### Gaps Summary

No code-level gaps. Every must-have from all three plans, all four ROADMAP success criteria, and all four HEADER requirements are verified against the actual files (not just SUMMARY claims). The CSS (raw-served) and EJS changes take effect on reload; the View.js label-mirror change is correct in source but only manifests in the browser after the known-deferred `npm run build` + backend restart — this is an expected deploy step, not a verification gap. The four pending items are inherently visual/runtime outcomes that cannot be confirmed by static inspection, hence status `human_needed`.
