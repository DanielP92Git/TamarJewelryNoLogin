<objective>
Execute touch device testing for Phase 9 Success Criterion #1 (Product reordering works on touch devices).

Purpose: Validate drag-and-drop functionality on iPad Safari and Android Chrome. This is the critical touch compatibility test - results determine if touch issues defer to v1.2.

Output: Touch device test results appended to 09-TEST-RESULTS.md
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Prepare Touch Testing Environment</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-TEST-RESULTS.md</files>
  <action>
Prepare for touch device testing and document the test plan.

**Option A: BrowserStack Live (recommended)**
- Navigate to browserstack.com/live
- If free trial available: Sign up for 30-day trial
- Select iPad (Safari) and Android Tablet (Chrome)
- Navigate to the admin panel URL

**Option B: Physical Devices**
- If user has physical iPad or Android tablet available
- Connect to same network as development server
- Navigate to admin panel URL

**Option C: Chrome DevTools Device Emulation (fallback)**
- Open Chrome DevTools > Toggle Device Toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
- Select iPad or Pixel tablet preset
- Enable touch simulation
- NOTE: This is NOT equivalent to real device testing - touch events differ

**Add section to 09-TEST-RESULTS.md:**
```markdown
## Touch Device Testing

### Test Environment
- Method: [BrowserStack Live / Physical Device / Chrome Emulation]
- Devices Tested: [list]
- Date: [date]
- Admin Panel URL: [url]

### Test Scenarios
1. Product List Drag-and-Drop
2. Image Gallery Drag-and-Drop
3. Modal Interactions
```

Prepare the test scenarios documentation structure before checkpoint.

**Execute these tests on iPad Safari and Android Chrome (via BrowserStack, physical device, or emulator):**

**Test 1: Product List Drag-and-Drop (Success Criterion #1)**
1. Navigate to Admin > Products > Select a category (e.g., Bracelets)
2. Click "Reorder Products" to enter reorder mode
3. Touch and hold the drag handle (grip icon) on any product row
4. Drag the product to a new position
5. Release to drop
6. Expected: Product moves to new position with animation
7. Click "Save Order"
8. Expected: Order persists after page refresh

**Test 2: Image Gallery Drag-and-Drop**
1. Open a product with multiple images (click row to open modal, then Edit)
2. In the image gallery, touch and hold a thumbnail's drag handle
3. Drag to reorder
4. Expected: Image moves with visual feedback
5. Save the product
6. Expected: Image order persists

**Test 3: Modal Touch Interactions**
1. Tap a product row to open preview modal
2. Tap Edit, Delete, Duplicate buttons (verify each works)
3. Tap X button to close
4. Tap outside modal (backdrop) to close
5. Expected: All interactions work as expected

**For each device, report:**
- Device/Browser: [iPad Safari / Android Chrome]
- Test 1 (Product Drag): [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL - describe]
- Test 2 (Image Drag): [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL - describe]
- Test 3 (Modal): [PASS / FAIL / PARTIAL - describe]
- Notes: [Any issues, lag, unexpected behavior]

**If touch drag fails:**
- Per CONTEXT.md: "Touch fallback: If touch drag-and-drop doesn't work well, defer to v1.2 (not blocking)"
- Document the issue and continue - this is NOT a v1.1 blocker
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Report test results for each device:
- "iPad Safari: [results]"
- "Android Chrome: [results]"
- Or "Skipping touch tests - no device access" (touch deferred to v1.2)
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Document Touch Test Results</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-TEST-RESULTS.md, .planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-BUGS.md</files>
  <action>
Document the touch device test results from the checkpoint.

**Update 09-TEST-RESULTS.md with actual results:**
```markdown
### iPad Safari Results
| Test | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Product Drag | [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL] | [notes] |
| Image Drag | [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL] | [notes] |
| Modal Touch | [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL] | [notes] |

### Android Chrome Results

| Modal Touch | [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL] | [notes] |

### Touch Testing Summary
- Overall Status: [PASS / PARTIAL / DEFERRED]
- v1.1 Impact: [None - passes / None - deferred to v1.2 / Blocking - needs fix]
```

**If any FAIL results, add to 09-BUGS.md:**
```markdown
### BUG-XXX: [Touch drag description]
- **Severity:** [low/medium/high] (likely low per CONTEXT.md - touch is not blocking)
- **Device:** [iPad Safari / Android Chrome]
- **Steps to Reproduce:** [steps]
- **Expected:** [expected behavior]
- **Actual:** [actual behavior]
- **Deferred:** v1.2 (per CONTEXT.md decision)

After all tasks complete:
1. Touch device test results documented for available devices
2. Any touch issues documented as v1.2 deferrals (not blocking)
3. Clear v1.1 impact assessment recorded
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Touch tests executed on available devices (iPad Safari, Android Chrome, or documented as skipped)
- Results documented with PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL status
- Any failures documented as v1.2 deferrals (not v1.1 blockers per CONTEXT.md)
