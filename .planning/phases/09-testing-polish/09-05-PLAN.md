<objective>
Make final v1.1 ship decision based on Phase 9 testing results and bug fixes.

Purpose: Synthesize all testing outcomes into a clear ship/no-ship decision. Document known issues for v1.2 roadmap. Close out v1.1 milestone.

Output: 09-SHIP-DECISION.md with final assessment, STATE.md updated with v1.1 completion status

  <name>Task 1: Assess Success Criteria</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-SHIP-DECISION.md</files>
  <action>
Create 09-SHIP-DECISION.md with assessment of all 6 Phase 9 success criteria.

**Success Criteria Assessment:**

From ROADMAP.md, Phase 9 success criteria:
1. Product reordering works on touch devices (iPad Safari, Android Chrome)
2. Drag-and-drop functions correctly in RTL Hebrew admin interface
3. Multiple admins reordering simultaneously produces no data corruption
4. Memory leak testing passes (20+ page navigations without heap growth)
5. Product lists with 200+ items perform acceptably during drag operations
6. All keyboard accessibility requirements met (reordering without mouse)

**Create 09-SHIP-DECISION.md:**
```markdown
# Phase 9: Ship Decision

**Date:** [date]
**Version:** v1.1

## Success Criteria Assessment

| # | Criterion | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Touch device drag-and-drop (iPad Safari, Android Chrome) | [PASS/PARTIAL/DEFER] | [from 09-02 results] |
| 2 | RTL Hebrew drag-and-drop | [PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL] | [from 09-03 results] |
| 3 | Concurrent admin - no data corruption | [PASS/FAIL] | [from 09-01 results] |
| 4 | Memory leak testing - 20+ navigations | [PASS/FAIL] | [from 09-01 results] |
| 5 | 200+ products performance | [PASS/ACCEPTABLE/DEFER] | [from 09-03 results] |
| 6 | Keyboard accessibility for reordering | [PASS/PARTIAL/DEFER] | [from 09-01 results] |

### Criterion Details

**1. Touch Device Support**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md touch section]

**2. RTL Support**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md RTL section]

**3. Concurrent Admin Safety**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md concurrent section]

**4. Memory Stability**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md memory section]

**5. Performance at Scale**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md performance section]

**6. Keyboard Accessibility**
[Summary from 09-TEST-RESULTS.md keyboard section]

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Document Known Issues for v1.2</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-SHIP-DECISION.md</files>
  <action>
Document all deferred issues for v1.2 roadmap.

**Append to 09-SHIP-DECISION.md:**
```markdown
## Known Issues (Deferred to v1.2)

### From Testing
| Issue | Category | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| [from 09-BUGS.md MEDIUM items] | | | |
| [from 09-BUGS.md LOW items] | | | |

### Expected Deferrals (per CONTEXT.md)
- Touch drag-and-drop optimization (if issues found)
- Extensive RTL testing
- Large catalog (200+) performance optimization
- Keyboard-based drag reordering (SortableJS limitation)

## v1.2 Roadmap Candidates

Based on Phase 9 findings, v1.2 should consider:

1. **Touch Experience Enhancement**
   - [specific improvements if touch had issues]

2. **Keyboard Accessibility Completion**
   - Add keyboard-based drag-and-drop (custom implementation or SortableJS plugin)
   - Move up/down buttons as alternative to drag

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Virtual scrolling for 200+ products
   - Pagination option

4. **RTL Polish**
   - [any RTL issues found]
```

  <how-to-verify>
**Review 09-SHIP-DECISION.md and make final ship decision:**

1. Open `.planning/phases/09-testing-polish/09-SHIP-DECISION.md`
2. Review success criteria assessment
3. Review known issues deferred to v1.2
4. Determine ship readiness:

**Ship Decision Options:**

**A. SHIP v1.1**
- All blocking issues resolved
- Core functionality works (product reordering, image reordering, modal)
- Known issues are acceptable deferrals

**B. DELAY v1.1**
- Blocking issues remain
- Core functionality broken
- Specify what must be fixed before ship

**C. SHIP with KNOWN ISSUES**
- Ship v1.1 with documented limitations
- Communicate known issues to users
- Fast-follow v1.2 planned

**Respond with:**
- "SHIP v1.1" — Ready to ship, no blockers
- "DELAY v1.1: [reason]" — Blocking issues need resolution
- "SHIP v1.1 with notes: [limitations]" — Ship with documented limitations
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>SHIP v1.1, DELAY v1.1: [reason], or SHIP v1.1 with notes: [limitations]</resume-signal>
