## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- SKU required for new products only (avoids forcing admin to retroactively add SKUs to entire catalog)
- Unique constraint on SKU field (prevents duplicate SKUs across products, ensures each is identifiable)
- Display as "SKU: ABC123" format (matches professional e-commerce conventions)
- Position at bottom of description (keeps SKU visible but secondary to product name/description/price)
