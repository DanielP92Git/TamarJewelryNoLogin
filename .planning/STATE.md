## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**v1.2 Roadmap Structure (2026-02-04):**
- 7 phases (10-16) derived from 80 requirements across 7 categories
- Phase 10 foundation MUST be first (prerequisite for all testing)
- Risk-based priority: Auth/Payments before Data/Files/Security
- Integration-first approach for monolithic backend (HTTP-boundary testing)
- Coverage target: 70-80% for critical paths (not 100% mandate)

**Test Infrastructure Approach:**
- Vitest for backend and frontend (modern, faster than Jest)
- mongodb-memory-server for isolated test database
- nock for HTTP mocking (PayPal, Stripe, exchange rate APIs)
- Environment validation to prevent production contamination
- Supertest for HTTP-boundary integration tests

**Backend Test Setup (10-01 through 10-06 - Completed):**
- Vitest configured with node environment and 30s timeout
- mongodb-memory-server provides in-memory database (127.0.0.1)
- Global test setup with automatic database lifecycle
- Environment safety guards prevent production contamination
- External API mocking with nock (PayPal, Stripe, S3, exchange rates)
- Test data fixtures and factories for consistent and unique test data
- Automated test cleanup (afterEach clears DB, resets counters, cleans mocks)
- Express app exported for supertest integration testing
- Test environment isolation (skip dotenv/connectDb/app.listen when NODE_ENV=test)
- 29 tests passing (20 infrastructure + 9 integration)
- Database helpers: connect, disconnect, clearDatabase, getUri
- Sample integration test template for Phase 11-16

**Environment Safety Guards (10-02, 10-03 - Completed):**
- Production environment detection and test abortion
- MongoDB URI validation (127.0.0.1 only)
- Payment credential clearing in test environment
- Unit tests confirm guard behavior (17 tests passing)

**External API Mocking (10-04 - Completed):**
- nock HTTP mocking library for API interception
- PayPal API mocks (auth, order creation, capture, errors)
- Stripe API mocks (payment intents, webhooks, errors)
- Exchange rate API mocks (primary, fallback, timeout scenarios)
- S3/Spaces mocks (upload, delete, get, errors)

**Test Environment Isolation Pattern (10-06):**
- Skip dotenv loading when NODE_ENV=test (prevents production credential leakage)
- Skip connectDb when NODE_ENV=test (setup.js handles connection)
- Skip app.listen when NODE_ENV=test (supertest makes requests without port)
- Clear MONGO_URL in setup.js beforeAll (prevents production DB access)
- Rationale: Tests must never access production resources; conditional checks provide clean separation

**Authentication Test Patterns (11-01 through 11-05 - Completed):**
- Counter-based unique email generation for test isolation
- Direct database queries (Users.findOne) to verify API behavior
- Password hashing verification: regex match ($2a$/$2b$) + bcrypt.compare
- bcrypt configuration tests: unique salts per password, cost factor 10
- Integration tests: HTTP boundary testing with supertest (55 tests)
- Unit tests: Middleware isolation with mock req/res (39 tests)
- Protected route testing via HTTP boundary (/getcart endpoint)
- Token validation: expired, invalid signature, malformed, missing payload
- Header format testing: auth-token, Bearer prefix, case sensitivity, priority
- RBAC patterns: admin access, regular user blocked, 401 vs 403 distinction
- userType validation: case sensitivity, exact match, edge cases
- Mock req/res/next pattern for Express middleware unit tests
- Promise wrapper for callback-based async middleware (bcrypt.compare)

**Payment Test Patterns (12-01, 12-02, 12-03 - Completed):**
- PayPal API mocking: auth token + order creation + capture flows
- Stripe checkout session mocking with nock HTTP interception
- Dummy test credentials in setup.js (backend requires credentials existence)
- Exchange rate API must be mocked in beforeEach for payment endpoint tests
- Timeout testing with delayConnection for realistic simulation
- Multi-currency cart testing (USD/ILS) in payment flows
- Error scenario validation: HTTP status + error message structure
- Payment endpoint pattern: mock auth → mock API call → verify response
- Validation-first testing: test input validation before external API mocking
- Product database setup required for checkout session tests
- Flexible error code assertions for PayPal rejection scenarios (400/404/500/502)
- Backend validation occurs inside createOrder function, not at endpoint level
- Invalid inputs may pass through to PayPal and be rejected with various error codes
- 53 tests covering PAY-01 through PAY-13 requirements (23 PayPal orders + 7 Stripe checkout + 23 validation)

**Currency Conversion Test Patterns (13-01, 13-02 - Completed):**
- Cron job testing: static schedule validation with node-cron.validate() (no timing tests)
- Product price recalculation: ILS-to-USD (Math.round(ils_price / rate)) and USD-to-ILS migration
- Exchange rate API fallback chain: API → stored DB rate → env variable → default constant (3.3)
- Round-trip conversion tolerance: ±2 acceptable for whole-number pricing
- Admin endpoint testing: requires admin auth, triggers exchange rate update
- Bidirectional math accuracy: USD→ILS and ILS→USD with edge cases (zero, large, small)
- Currency symbol mapping: $ for USD, ₪ for ILS
- Math.round behavior verification: 0.5 rounds up (JavaScript standard, not banker's rounding)
- Legacy product migration: products with USD-only get ILS backfilled via reverse calculation
- Modern product recalculation: products with ILS get USD recalculated on rate changes
- 36 tests covering CURR-03 through CURR-09 requirements (11 unit + 25 integration)

**File Upload Test Patterns (14-01, 14-02 - Completed):**
- Programmatic image generation: Sharp create API for JPEG/PNG/WebP buffers (no fixture files)
- Oversized buffer testing: PNG with compressionLevel 0 for predictable 60MB files
- Supertest .attach() for multipart/form-data file uploads
- S3 mock persistence: scope.persist() for multiple file upload operations
- MIME type validation: PDF, BMP, SVG, TXT magic bytes for rejection testing
- File size limit enforcement: Multer LIMIT_FILE_SIZE error with 413 status
- Authentication requirements: fetchUser + requireAdmin middleware on upload endpoint
- Users created in beforeEach (not beforeAll) due to global afterEach database clearing
- Sharp real processing tests: not mocked, verifies actual format conversion and resize behavior
- Format conversion: JPEG/PNG/WebP → WebP output (FILE-06)
- Image resizing: desktop (1200px) and mobile (600px) variants (FILE-05)
- Corrupt image handling: failOnError: false means flexible behavior (200 or 500+) (FILE-07)
- Dimension handling: tiny (1x1) and large (4000x3000) images process correctly (FILE-10)
- Local file path fallback: S3 unconfigured in test environment, URLs use /uploads/ prefix (FILE-09)
- S3 mock verification: mockS3Upload/mockS3Delete/mockS3Error interceptor validation (FILE-08, FILE-11)
- 41 tests covering FILE-01 through FILE-11 requirements (18 validation + 9 processing + 14 upload flow)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**v1.1 Deferred Issues (for v1.2+):**
- BUG-02 (HIGH): Keyboard reordering (WCAG 2.1.2 violation) - requires move up/down buttons
- BUG-03 (LOW): Custom focus-visible styling - cosmetic polish
- Touch device testing unverified - SortableJS documented as touch-aware but not validated

**v1.2 Infrastructure Prerequisites:**
- No test coverage currently (zero baseline)
- Monolithic backend (3,662 lines) makes unit testing difficult
- Production database/API contamination risk during test development
- Must establish safe infrastructure before writing any tests
